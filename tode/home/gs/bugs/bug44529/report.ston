TDStringLeafNode{#name:'report',#contents:'44529  P2  \'(each.name = \'\'Eve\'\') | (each.name = \'\'Brian\'\')\' incorrectly optimized to (false)
-------------------------------
If the query were using the & operator, it would be correct to reduce the query to (false), but not when the operator is |
----
The previously mentioned optimization does not apply queries involving set-value path terms. This query is valid:

  \'(each.tags.* = \'\'soccer\'\') & (each.tags.* = \'\'magic\'\')\'',#creationTime:DateAndTime['2014-08-29T09:33:37.2384059429168-07:00'],#modificationTime:DateAndTime['2014-08-29T09:34:32.9038069248199-07:00']}

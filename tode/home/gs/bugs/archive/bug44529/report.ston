TDStringLeafNode{#name:'report',#contents:'44529  P2  \'(each.name = \'\'Eve\'\') | (each.name = \'\'Brian\'\')\' incorrectly optimized to (false)
-------------------------------

----
The previously mentioned optimization does not apply queries involving set-value path terms. This query is valid:

  \'(each.tags.* = \'\'soccer\'\') & (each.tags.* = \'\'magic\'\')\'',#creationTime:DateAndTime['2014-08-30T09:46:52.8060059547424-07:00'],#modificationTime:@2}

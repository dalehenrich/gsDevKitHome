TDStringLeafNode{#name:'todo',#contents:'1. still curious about this message when using WARemoteDebuggingWalkbackErrorHandler:
  --transcript--\'Error creating WAWalkback: WAGsInvalidCallbackContext: You can only #call: and #answer: from within a callback or a Task.\'
2. probably should look at what gets returned to the server although it\'s probably okay ...
3. How should the WAGemStoneWalkbackErrorHandler test be handled ... I would be really happy if the zinc stack handled the error correctly ....

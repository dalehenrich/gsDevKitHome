44140  P2  better prim failure code needed for String>>encodeUsing: and MultiByteString>>encodeUsing: (primitive 654)

44805  P2  seasidetst and friends failing in 3.3
44474  P2  GsCore and GsMisc GLASS configurations need to be updated for GemStone3.3
  l_:  removing tests a scaling back on expectations: 

     /ernie/glassBug38177tst.pl - build test only anyway
     /ernie/glass1tst.pl        - full glass1 install (GsUpgrader run) ... run all unit tests
     /ernie/glasstst.pl         - install master run only 
     /ernie/monticellotst.pl    = monticello bootstrap tests 
     /ernie/seasidetst.pl       - full glass1 and seaside install ... run all unit tests

     rerun ... 
       - legitimate glass1tst bug related to ReadStream work (probably) 
       - 100+ failures in seasidetst
     - Grease, GLASS1, and Seaside31 updated for GemStone 3.3
     - add zinc, gsdevkithome, ??? test runs

     build, battery, ..... (checkin 44140 changes need ernie/smk) ... conversion tests ... copy mcz files to http repos (44474) ... add zinc tests?

44035  P2  my selector path term example doesn't work
      ---> adapt Lisa's example to use modification tracking.
           consider additional more complicated examples of modification tracking scenario's
           some of these examples should be added to the selector based path term tests
           this example needs to be folded into Ernie ....

  n_:  
      1. update SolderNscModificationTracker to add/remove ojbect to/from index
      2. attach smalltalk to bug
      3. but code in examples directory
      4. pass to Alex for test creation and example development

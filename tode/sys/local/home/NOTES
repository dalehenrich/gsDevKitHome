LITHIUM_m:


==========================================

44474  P2  GsCore and GsMisc GLASS configurations need to be updated for GemStone3.3
       - New version of Grease released before 3.3 released ...
       - New Grease release (1.1.13 ... for backward compat OR 1.2.0 for 3.3 and moving
         forward?) 
         - before Grease is published to master:
---->      1. publish new GsUpgrader
---->      2. publish new GLASS1 --> waiting for clean travis runs
---->      3. publish ConfigurationOfGsCore and ConfigurationOfGLASS (plus others? ... test first)
              - ConfigurationOfGsMonticello-dkh.174.mcz
              - ConfigurationOfGsMisc-dkh.117.mcz
              - ConfigurationOfGLASS-dkh.255.mcz
              - ConfigurationOfGsCore-dkh.301.mcz
           4. publish new Grease
45390  P2  FileTree uses `endodeAsUtf8 asString` combo which should be replaced with encodeAsUTF8intoString
       - FileTree needs work for 3.3 as it is sending encodeAsUtf8 ... should be using 
         encodeAsUTF8intoString but that has dependency implications ... and bootstrap implications
       - battery tests needed
41153  P3  classes missing a comment method
44012  P2  New indexing classes do not have class comments

45430  P3  Utf8 API changes for 3.3 --- fixed time to rumba ... make changes in Seaside, Grease, etc.
       - Utf8 at:put:
       - System class>>performOnServer: returns Utf8?
         There's code that decodes this is tODE not needed once change is made
       - Suggested changes:
         - Utf8
           bytsIntoString 
           decodeToString
           deocdeToUnicode
         String
           decodeFromUtf8ToString
           decodeFromUtf8ToUnicode
         the decode* messages should replace decodeFromUTF8 in all cases ...

-----
Main Grease repo is now https://github.com/SeasideSt/Grease ,,, convert all references to use that one ... as you touch things ...

Tode todo/nice to have:
      4. `mc compare` fix space
      5. `ol` smalltalk api
      6. cache stats command/api
      7. hook roassal in via an option for object references
      8. tODE override ByteArray>>printOn: and Utf8>>printOn:
      9. direct list of windows in main menu?
     10. compound windows, yeah?
     12. `options` instead of `limit` ... auto load of options

LITHIUM_m:


==========================================

44474  P2  GsCore and GsMisc GLASS configurations need to be updated for GemStone3.3
       - New version of Grease released before 3.3 released ...
       - New Grease release (1.1.13 ... for backward compat OR 1.2.0 for 3.3 and moving
         forward?) 
         - before Grease is published to master:
           1. publish new GsUpgrader
           2. [] publish new GLASS1
           3. publish ConfigurationOfGsCore and ConfigurationOfGLASS
           4. publish new Grease
45390  P2  FileTree uses `endodeAsUtf8 asString` combo which should be replaced with encodeAsUTF8intoString
       - FileTree needs work for 3.3 as it is sending encodeAsUtf8 ... should be using 
         encodeAsUTF8intoString but that has dependency implications ... and bootstrap implications
       - battery tests needed
41153  P3  classes missing a comment method
44012  P2  New indexing classes do not have class comments

45430  P3  Utf8 API changes for 3.3 --- fixed time to rumba ... make changes in Seaside, Grease, etc.
       - Utf8 at:put:
       - System class>>performOnServer: returns Utf8?
         There's code that decodes this is tODE not needed once change is made
       - Suggested changes:
         - Utf8
           bytsIntoString 
           decodeToString
           deocdeToUnicode
         String
           decodeFromUtf8ToString
           decodeFromUtf8ToUnicode
         the decode* messages should replace decodeFromUTF8 in all cases ...

Main Grease repo is now https://github.com/SeasideSt/Grease ,,, convert all references to use that one ... as you touch things ...

      45450  P2  Wrong positionableStreams installed after 3106->33 upgrade

  l_: (nolog) 
     - not tranlogged objects have not debug logging? Would be useful to be able to know when they were created and committed without official tranlog records
     - Is there a prim call that can be used to determine if an object is not-tranlogged or not?
     - if the keys for NotTranloggedGlobals were tranlogged and the values were not-tranlogged it would make using these puppies much easier
       - `beTranlogged`, forces an object to be a tranlogged object use this on the "keys".
What happens during migration with GsDeployer?
     - example of migration (become:) causing a problem.

  m_: [45430  P3  Utf8 API changes for 3.3 --- fixed time to rumba] 
       - Utf8 at:put:
       - System class>>performOnServer: returns Utf8?
         There's code that decodes this is tODE not needed once change is made
       - Suggested changes:
         - Utf8
           bytsIntoString 
           decodeToString
           deocdeToUnicode
         String
           decodeFromUtf8ToString
           decodeFromUtf8ToUnicode
         the decode* messages should replace decodeFromUTF8 in all cases ...

==========================================

44474  P2  GsCore and GsMisc GLASS configurations need to be updated for GemStone3.3
       - New version of Grease released before 3.3 released ...
         - before Grease is published to master:
           1. publish new GsUpgrader
           2. [] publish new GLASS1
           3. publish ConfigurationOfGsCore and ConfigurationOfGLASS
           4. publish new Grease
45390  P2  FileTree uses `endodeAsUtf8 asString` combo which should be replaced with encodeAsUTF8intoString
       - FileTree needs work for 3.3 as it is sending encodeAsUtf8 ... should be using 
         encodeAsUTF8intoString but that has dependency implications ... and bootstrap implications
       - battery tests needed
45391  P2  STON needs to be ported to 3.3
       - battery tests needed
41153  P3  classes missing a comment method
44012  P2  New indexing classes do not have class comments

--------------------
TDShellFsToSimpleComposedFsMvCpCommandTests>>testDirectoryNodeMv is failing because mv command is not creating leaf nodes in the target directory...

TDFileSystemDirectoryNode inherits addAsChildOfFileSystemDirectoryNode: from TDDirectoryNode and it probably ought to be re-implemented in TDFileSystemDirectoryNode ... interesting that we haven\'t seen this issue before ... probably should be implemented using addChildFileSystemLeafNode:.
